# This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. 
# Let a[i] be the number of binary strings of length i which do 
# not contain any two consecutive 1â€™s and which end in 0. Similarly,
# let b[i] be the number of such strings which end in 1.
# We can append either 0 or 1 to a string ending in 0, 
# but we can only append 0 to a string ending in 1.
# This yields the recurrence relation: 

# a[i] = a[i - 1] + b[i - 1]
# b[i] = a[i - 1] 

# The base cases of above recurrence are a[1] = b[1] = 1. 
# The total number of strings of length i is just a[i] + b[i].
