# Given two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list denoting wordList of unique words
#  of equal lengths. Find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from startWord to targetWord. 
#  You can return them in any order possible.
# Keep the following conditions in mind:

#     A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
#     Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
#     Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
#     startWord may or may not be part of the wordList.
#     Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.

# The first part of this problem can be found here.


# Example 1:

# Input:
# startWord = "der", targetWord = "dfs",
# wordList = {"des","der","dfr","dgt","dfs"}
# Output:
# der dfr dfs
# der des dfs
# Explanation:
# The length of the smallest transformation is 3.
# And the following are the only two ways to get
# to targetWord:-
# "der" -> "des" -> "dfs".
# "der" -> "dfr" -> "dfs".


# For example
# wordList = {"des","der","dfr","dgt","dfs"}
# startWord = "der", targetWord= "dfs"
# pattern: des ->*es
#  		   |  \ 
#         d*s  de*
#we will try each word to map to the pattern
#and we form a adjancency list corresponding to the pattern

# Approach
# First let's see what the problem asked

# Path to the endWord
# This path should be shortest
# The Second point ðŸ‘† can be solved by simple BFS ( Solution is same as Word Ladder-I. Click this link for solution )

# But we need to modify the code of Word Ladder-I to store the level / distance of each node from our startWord(source node)

# After BFS We got the distance at which our endWord/target exists so

# Apply Simple Iterative DFS
# by maintaining the path
# and when we encounter the target just append the path to our result
# âš  One important thing which doing dfs is that only traverse
# from nodes in lower level - - to nodes in higher level
# You can see that in the code where the condition is
# dist[child] > dist[node]
# this means that the child node is of next level
# By this way we can make sure that we do not loop in the graph forever
