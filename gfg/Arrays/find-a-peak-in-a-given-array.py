# Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
# Output: 20
# The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15,
# both of them are less than 20.

# Input: array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
# Output: 20 or 90
# The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15, 
# both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbours 23 and 67.

# Following corner cases give better idea about the problem. 

# If input array is sorted in strictly increasing order, the last element is always a peak element. For example, 50 is peak element in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
# If the input array is sorted in strictly decreasing order, the first element is always a peak element. 100 is the peak element in {100, 80, 60, 50, 20}.
# If all elements of input array are same, every element is a peak element.


# It is clear from the above examples that there is always a peak element in the input array.

# Naive Approach: The array can be traversed and the element whose neighbours are less than that element can be returned.
# Algorithm: 

# If in the array, the first element is greater than the second or the last element is greater than the second last, print the respective element and terminate the program.
# Else traverse the array from the second index to the second last index
# If for an element array[i], it is greater than both its neighbours, i.e., array[i] > array[i-1] and array[i] > array[i+1], then print that element and terminate.

# Can be used to find a peak in O(Logn) time. The idea is based on the technique of Binary Search to check if 
# the middle element is the peak element or not. If the middle element is not the peak element, 
# then check if the element on the right side is greater than the middle element then there is always
# a peak element on the right side. If the element on the left side is greater than the middle element
# then there is always a peak element on the left side. Form a recursion and the peak element can be found in log n time. 

# Algorithm: 

# Create two variables, l and r, initialize l = 0 and r = n-1
# Iterate the steps below till l <= r, lowerbound is less than the upperbound
# Check if the mid value or index mid = (l+r)/2, is the peak element or not, if yes then print the element and terminate.
# Else if the element on the left side of the middle element is greater then check for peak element on the left side, i.e. update r = mid â€“ 1
# Else if the element on the right side of the middle element is greater then check for peak element on the right side, i.e. update l = mid + 1
