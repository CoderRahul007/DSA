# An efficient solution is to use heap data structure.
#  The time complexity of heap based solution is O(N Log k).  Space O(k)
#  where N is count of all elements

# Create an output array.
# Create a min heap of size k and insert 1st element in all the arrays into the heap
# Repeat following steps while priority queue is not empty.
# Remove minimum element from heap (minimum is always at root) and store it in output array.
# Insert next element from the array from which the element is extracted. If the array doesnâ€™t have any more elements,
#  then do nothing.
