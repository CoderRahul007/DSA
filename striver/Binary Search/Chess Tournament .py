#  Bruteforce

# The possible answer can be from 1 to max( positions[i] ) so we select one integer at a time form 
# 1 to max( positions[i] ) and see if it is possible for that integer to be our answer.
# Now how will we find whether an integer X is our possible answer or not? We can try to add the maximum
#  number of players such that the distance between any two players is more than one equal to X.
# How can we implement this? We can sort the positions first and can assume the first player is in the 
# room first that is empty( positions[0] ). Now we will give a new room positions[i] to the next player 
# only if the difference between the current room ( positions[i] ) and the previous allocated room is 
# greater than or equal to X.
# If by doing this we can allocate rooms to at least C players, the answer exists otherwise not.
# Optimization: once we find  X for which the answer does not exist then we can simply stop our search 
# because the answer will be possible for all Xâ€™s greater than current X.
# The answer is the maximum possible X.

# Time Complexity

# O(N * max), where N is the total number of rooms and max is the maximum possible position for any room.

# As we have to traverse all the possible answers and the answers are up to max. For each possible answer, we have to traverse all the positions of the room which is N. Hence, the overall Time Complexity is O(N * max).
# Space Complexity

# O(1).
