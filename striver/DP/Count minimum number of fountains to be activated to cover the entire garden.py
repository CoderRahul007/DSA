# There is a one-dimensional garden of length N. In each position of the N length garden,
#  a fountain has been installed. Given an array a[]such that a[i] describes the coverage
#  limit of ith fountain. A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) 
# to min(i + a[i], N). In beginning, all the fountains are switched off. The task is to find
#  the minimum number of fountains needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.

# Examples:

# Input: a[] = {1, 2, 1}
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# For position 1: a[1] = 1, range = 1 to 2
# For position 2: a[2] = 2, range = 1 to 3
# For position 3: a[3] = 1, range = 2 to 3
# Therefore, the fountain at position a[2] covers the whole garden.
# Therefore, the required output is 1.

# Input: a[] = {2, 1, 1, 2, 1} 
# Output: 2
