# Note :

# The width of each bar is the same and is equal to 1.

# We can use a Stack to track the bars that are bounded by the longer left and right bars. 
# This can be done using only one iteration using stacks.

# Approach:

# 1. Loop through the indices of the bar array.

# 2. For each bar, we can do the following:

# While the Stack is not empty and the current bar has a height greater than the top bar of the stack,
# Store the index of the top bar in pop_height and pop it from the Stack.
# Find the distance between the left bar(current top) of the popped bar and the current bar.
# Find the minimum height between the top bar and the current bar.
# The maximum water that can be trapped in distance * min_height.
# The water trapped, including the popped bar, is (distance * min_height) â€“ height[pop_height].
# Add that to the fans.
# 3. Final answer will the ans.

# Method 5 (Two Pointer Approach)

# Approach: At every index, The amount of rainwater stored is the difference between
#  the current index height and a minimum of left max height and right max-height
# Algorithm :
# Take two pointers l and r. Initialize l to the starting index 0 and r to the last index n-1
# Since l is the first element, left_max would be 0, and right max for r would be 0
# While l <= r, iterate the array. We have two possible conditions
# Condition1 : left_max <= right max
# Consider Element at index l
# Since we have traversed all elements to the left of l, left_max is known 
# For the right max of l, We can say that the right max would  always be >= current r_max here
# So, min(left_max,right_max) would always equal to left_max in this case
# Increment l
# Condition2 : left_max >  right max
# Consider Element at index r
# Since we have traversed all elements to the right of r, right_max is known
# For the left max of l, We can say that the left max would  always be >= current l_max here
# So, min(left_max,right_max) would always equal to right_max in this case
# Decrement r
# Implementation:

# Python3 implementation of the approach
  
# Function to return the maximum
# water that can be stored
