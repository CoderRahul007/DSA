# Convert to linked list which follows preorder of binary tree
#  Create A New Linked List

#     A brute approach to solve this problem is by iterating over the tree in the pre-order fashion.
#     While traversing, store the values of the nodes in a list.
#     Create the required linked list using the stored values.

# Time Complexity

# O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.


# We are visiting every node of the tree once. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(N).
# Space Complexity

# O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

 

# O(N) extra space is required for creating a new linked list. Hence, overall space complexity is O(N).

# Using Constant Extra Space

# This approach is similar to the previous recursive approach.
# The idea is to iteratively traverse the tree.
# While exploring the current node we place its right subtree (of the current node) at
# the correct position in the tree (i.e. make it the right child of the rightmost node in the
# left subtree, pre-order predecessor) and make the left subtree the new right subtree of the current node.
# This way we can also avoid keeping track of the last node of the linked list.
 
# Below is the detailed algorithm:  

#     Let 'CURRENTNODE' store the node presently being explored.
#     We start by exploring the root node. So, initialize 'CURRENTNODE' with the root node.
#     Repeat the following steps until 'CURRENTNODE' becomes NULL:
#         If the current node has a left child:
#             Find the rightmost node present in the left subtree and make the right subtree of
#             the current node as its right child.
#             Make the left subtree of the current node as the new right subtree.
#             Set the left child of the current node is NULL.
#         Set 'CURRENTNODE' to 'CURRENTNODE'â€™s right child.
#     Return the head of the linked list.

# Time Complexity

# O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

# Even though it may seem that we are iterating over the left subtree for every node,
# as we make the left subtree the new right subtree of the current node, we don't traverse 
# these nodes (present in the left subtree) again. So, we visit every node of the tree at most twice,
# once during the traversal and once to find the correct position for the right subtree. 
# Hence, the overall time complexity is O(2*N) = O(N).
# Space Complexity

# O(1)
