# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level,
#  and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

# struct Node {
#   int val;
#   Node *left;
#   Node *right;
#   Node *next;
# }
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next
#  right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate
# each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
# The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers,
#  with '#' signifying the end of each level.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = []
# Output: []


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# iterative

# Now, we need to populate next pointers of each node with nodes that occur
# to its immediate right on the same level. This can easily be done with BFS.
#  Since for each node, we require the right node on the same level, we will
#  perform a right-to-left BFS instead of the standard left-to-right BFS.

# Before starting the traversal of each level, we would initialize a rightNode
#  variable set to NULL. Then, since we are performing right-to-left BFS,
#   we would be starting at rightmost node of each level. We set the next node
#   of cur as rightNode and update rightNode = cur. This would ensure that each
#   node would be assigned its rightNode properly while traversing from right to left.
# Also, if cur has a child, we would first push its right child and only then its
# left child (since we are doing right-to-left BFS). Once BFS is completed (after queue becomes empty),
#  all next node would be populated and we can finally return root.


class Solution:
    def connect(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None
        q = deque([root])
        while q:
            rightNode = None
            n = len(q)

            for _ in range(n):

                cur = q.popleft()
                cur.next = rightNode
                rightNode = cur  # step back

                if cur.right:
                    q.extend([cur.right, cur.left])
        return root


# Time Complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the given tree.
#  We only traverse the tree once using BFS which requires O(N).
# Space Complexity : O(W) = O(N), where W is the width of given tree.
#  This is required to store the nodes in queue. Since the given tree is a perfect binary tree,
#   its width is given as W = (N+1)/2 â‰ˆ O(N)

# Recursive

# We can also populate the next pointers recursively using DFS.
# This is slightly different logic than above but relies on the fact that the given tree is a perfect binary tree.

# In the above solution, we had access to right nodes since we traversed in level-order.
# But in DFS, once we go to the next level, we cant get access to right node.
#  So, we must update next pointers of the child of each node from the its parent's level itself.
#  Thus at each recursive call -

# If child node exists:

# assign next of left child node as right child node: root -> left -> next = root -> right.
#  Note that, if once child exists, the other exists as well.
# assign next of right child node as left child of root's next (if root's next exists):
# root -> right -> next = root -> next -> left.
# How? We need right immediate node of right child. This wont exist if current root's next node doesnt exists.
#  If next node of current root is present (the next pointer of root would already be populated in above level) ,
#  the right immediate node of root's right child must be root's next's left child because if child of root exists,
#  then the child of root's next must also exist.
# If child node doesn't exist, we have reached the last level, we can directly return since there's no child nodes to populate their next pointers

# The process is very similar to the one illustrated in the image below with just the difference that we are traversing with DFS instead of BFS shown below.

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None
        L, R, N = root.left, root.right, root.next

            L.next = R

            self.connect(L)
            self.connect(R)
        return root

# Time Complexity : O(N), each node is only traversed once
# Space Complexity : O(logN), required for recursive stack.
# The maximum depth of recursion is equal to the height of tree which in this case of perfect binary tree is equal to O(logN)
