# For Binary search tree, while traversing the tree from top to bottom the first node which
#  lies in between the two numbers n1 and n2 is the LCA of the nodes, i.e. the first node n 
#  with the lowest depth which lies in between n1 and n2 (n1<=n<=n2) n1 < n2. 

# So just recursively traverse the BST , if nodeâ€™s value is greater than both n1 and n2 then 
# our LCA lies in the left side of the node, if it is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA 
# lies on the right side. Otherwise, the root is LCA (assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST)

# Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

# Create a recursive function that takes a node and the two values n1 and n2.
# If the value of the current node is less than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies in the right subtree. 
# Call the recursive function for the right subtree.
# If the value of the current node is greater than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies in the left subtree.
#  Call the recursive function for the left subtree.
# If both the above cases are false then return the current node as LCA.
