# You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height 
# h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes
#  which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the
#   dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the
#    2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so
#  that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of 
#  the same type of box. 

# We need to build a maximum height stack. 
# Following are the key points to note in the problem statement: 
# 1) A box can be placed on top of another box only if both width and 
# depth of the upper placed box are smaller than width and depth of the lower box respectively. 
# 2) We can rotate boxes such that width is smaller than depth. For example, 
# if there is a box with dimensions {1x2x3} where 1 is height, 2Ã—3 is base, 
# then there can be three possibilities, {1x2x3}, {2x1x3} and {3x1x2} 
# 3) We can use multiple instances of boxes. What it means is, we can have two 
# different rotations of a box as part of our maximum height stack.

# Method 1 : dynamic programming using tabulation

# 1) Generate all 3 rotations of all boxes. The size of rotation array
#  becomes 3 times the size of the original array. 
# For simplicity, we consider width as always smaller than or equal to depth. 
# 2) Sort the above generated 3n boxes in decreasing order of base area.
# 3) After sorting the boxes, the problem is same as LIS with following optimal substructure property. 
# MSH(i) = Maximum possible Stack Height with box i at top of stack 
# MSH(i) = { Max ( MSH(j) ) + height(i) } where j < i and width(j) > width(i) and depth(j) > depth(i). 
# If there is no such j then MSH(i) = height(i)
# 4) To get overall maximum height, we return max(MSH(i)) where 0 < i < n
# Following is the implementation of the above solution.
